# Profusely Violent Progression

A collection of V Rising mods to facilitate fun open-world PVP.

## Scope
- Patching exploits
- Adjusting crutch mechanics
- Tuning numbers to keep fights feeling fun

## Principles
- Players should be able to have an interesting fight with anybody they see, wherever they see them.
- PVP Stat differences due to progression/grinding should be very minor.
- PVE progression should feel about the same as it does in vanilla gameplay.
- There should be a variety of competitive builds. If something is overperforming it probably needs to be nerfed.
