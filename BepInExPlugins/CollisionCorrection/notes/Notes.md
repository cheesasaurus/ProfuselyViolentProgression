HitColliderCast

When HitColliderCast.PrimaryTargets_Count is 0, a projectile seems to phase through walls.
When HitColliderCast.PrimaryTargets_Count is 1, a projectile is not necessarily blocked by walls.


The problem with Curse and Carrion Swarm seems to be related to having multiple projectiles.

Curse: launches 5 projectiles. When colliding with a castle wall/gate, 4 continue through. (only 1 projectile disappears).
When colliding with a second gate after the first, out of the 4 projectiles, 3 continue through. (1 more projectile disappears).
